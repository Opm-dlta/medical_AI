{"text": "[INST] What is the recommended treatment for Diarrhoeal disease? [/INST]\\nOverview: Diarrhoeal disease is the third leading cause of death in children under 5 years old and is responsible for killing around 443 832 children every year. Diarrhoea can last several days and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. In the past, for most people, severe dehydration and fluid loss were the main causes of diarrhoea-associated deaths. Now, other causes such as septic bacterial infections are likely to account for an increasing proportion of all diarrhoea-associated deaths. Children who are malnourished or have impaired immunity, as well as people living with HIV, are most at risk of life-threatening diarrhoea.\\nDiarrhoea is defined as the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual). Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhoea, nor is the passing of loose, pasty stools by breastfed babies.\\nDiarrhoea is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene.\\nInterventions to prevent diarrhoea, including safe drinking-water, use of improved sanitation and hand washing with soap, can reduce disease risk. Diarrhoea should be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS), a solution of clean water, sugar and salt. In addition, a 10–14 day supplemental treatment course of dispersible zinc tablets shortens diarrhoea duration and improves outcomes.\\nThere are 3 clinical types of diarrhoea:\\n\\nHome care:\\n• Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration (water, diluted fruit juices, clear broths)\\n• Use oral rehydration solution (ORS) - mix one packet in clean water according to instructions\\n• Continue eating regular foods as tolerated, especially easily digestible foods like rice, bananas, toast, and applesauce\\n• Practice good hand hygiene - wash hands thoroughly with soap and water\\n• Rest as much as possible to aid recovery\\n• Clean and disinfect bathroom surfaces regularly to prevent spread\\n\\nMedication:\\n• Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is the primary treatment - prepared by dissolving ORS packets in clean water\\n• Zinc supplements (10-20mg daily for 10-14 days) - reduces severity and duration, especially important for children\\n• Anti-diarrheal medications generally not recommended, especially for infectious diarrhea or in children\\n• Antibiotics only when prescribed by healthcare providers for specific bacterial causes\\n• Probiotics may help restore gut flora, especially after antibiotic treatment\\n\\nWhen to seek help:\\n• Signs of dehydration (extreme thirst, dry mouth, little or no urination, severe weakness, dizziness)\\n• Blood in stool or black, tarry stools\\n• Fever above 38.5°C (101.3°F)\\n• Severe abdominal or rectal pain\\n• Diarrhea lasting more than 2 days in adults or 24 hours in children\\n• Signs of severe dehydration in children (sunken eyes, decreased skin elasticity, lethargy)\\n• Symptoms in infants, elderly, or people with compromised immune systems"}
